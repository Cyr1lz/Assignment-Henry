/* 
 A farmer has a farm located at Epe in Lagos. The farm is 2000sqm in length an 3000sqm in width. He has 50 chickens, 10 goats, and 2 fish ponds.

 1. Determine the Area of the farm in square
 2. Output the address of the farm including the town.
 3. Create an Object that models the farm.

 Tips: 
 1. Use appropiate variables
 2. Model the farm using an Object and output it to console.

 let obj = {
    prop1: value1,
    prop2: value2
 }

 4. Output a story using the farm object properties
